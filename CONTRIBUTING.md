# JDK Comparison Contribution Guide

Contributions are welcome.

Here are a few rules we ask you to follow to make the experience more pleasant for everyone involved.

## Rules

The rules should ensure that you do not waste your time on PRs that we ultimately have to reject to keep the project viable. They should help you avoid extensive rework, too.

1. Please ask before preparing a PR that introduces new JDKs or adds criteria. Add some justification.
2. Start small. For example, add a single JDK version to begin with.
3. If you change data points, clarify why you believe the changes are necessary. Furthermore, provide instructions that help verify the changes.
4. If you work for a vendor, please state it in the PR description.

## Getting Help

Do you not know what to fill into a field?

-   There is JSDoc on every field that should provide guidance.
-   Ask for assistance, either on GitHub or by sending an e-mail (address can be found on jdkcomparison.com)
-   There is no shame in putting down "unknown".
