## Which JDK Do You Recommend?

None.

This comparison aims to give you an overview of what JDKs are available and help you narrow your choices.

If you are looking for an opinionated guide, other sites offer that, for example, [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com/).

## Is the JDK That Ticks All the Boxes the Best?

No.

More precisely, it might be the best, but not because it ticks all the boxes.

The primary reason is that ticked boxes (or full circles, as they are currently displayed) **indicate presence, not quality**.

## How Do I Find the Best JDK for Me?

1. Jot down your requirements.
2. Create a shortlist with the help of the comparison table.
3. Examine each entry on the shortlist.
4. Pick the one that fits your requirements best.

Examining each entry on the shortlist should include the following tasks:

-   Try each JDK and all the functionality you need, at least on your machine and in your test environment.
-   Watch whether you receive updates in time and whether the quality is acceptable.
-   If you require specific functionality (for example, a garbage collector) on an older JDK, ask the vendor whether they maintain that functionality or at least backport patches. Areas notorious for widely varying levels of support are garbage collectors, platform support (especially anything beyond x86, 64-bit, and ARM, 64-bit), and functionality like JavaFX or Web Start that has been removed from OpenJDK.
-   If you require support, talk to the vendor about their offering and ask them to walk you through how they would handle a specific issue you had in the past.

## What JDKs Do You Plan on Adding? Why Are Some Missing?

The plan is to include all JDKs that are intended for production use and target a broader audience. Therefore, builds that are supposed to facilitate the development of a JDK or are primarily used internally by a vendor will not make it on the list.

JDKs that we plan to add, sorted alphabetically:

-   [Alibaba Dragonwell](https://dragonwell-jdk.io/)
-   [Azul Platform Prime](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)
-   [IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/)
-   [OpenLogic OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
-   [Oracle GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) (starting with GraalVM 23 to be released in June 2023)
-   [Red Hat Build of OpenJDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)

JDKs that we do not plan on adding, sorted alphabetically:

-   [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Renamed to Eclipse Temurin.
-   All JDKs included in Linux distributions: Those that are not already on the list like Amazon Corretto (in Amazon Linux) are no stand-alone products. Furthermore, they would bloat the comparison even more.
-   [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime): Serves as platform for JetBrains' IntelliJ-based IDE, only.
-   [OJDKBuild](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild): Discontinued.
-   [Trava OpenJDK](https://github.com/TravaOpenJDK): Seems to primarily target developers, and to be dormant.

JDKs we are not sure about, sorted alphabetically:

-   [Axiom JDK](https://axiomjdk.ru/): Looks like a rebrand of BellSoft Liberica JDK for the Russian market.
-   [Huawei BiSheng](https://www.openeuler.org/en/other/projects/bishengjdk/): Unclear whether it is targeting an audience outside of Huawei.
-   [Tencent Kona](https://github.com/Tencent/): Unclear whether it is targeting an audience outside of Tencent.

## Where Can I Learn More about Differences Between Versions?

The comparison does not include language-level differences between versions because there are no language-level differences between vendors.

For a great overview of language-level differences between versions, see [The Java Version Almanac](https://javaalmanac.io/). Furthermore, the [list of JDK Enhancement Proposals](https://openjdk.org/jeps/0) (JEP) details both language-level differences and technological changes like ports or garbage collectors.

## What Are My Options If I Need JavaFX?

JavaFX is a GUI toolkit that was part of Oracle JDK until version 10. Since then, [it has been unbundled from the JDK](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/the-future-of-javafx-and-other-java-client-roadmap-updates). The development has moved to the [OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/) project

OpenJFX is available as a separate download. Application developers should ship OpenJFX as part of their application and no longer rely on it being part of the JDK. [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com/) provides dedicated support for OpenJFX (see [JavaFX Long-Term Support](https://gluonhq.com/services/javafx-support/)).

For compatibility reasons, some vendors offer newer or even the latest JDK bundled with OpenJFX. Those are mentioned in the comparison table under _Customisations_ â†’ _Editions_.

## What Are My Options If I Need Java Web Start?

Java Web Start allows downloading and starting Java applications directly from the internet using JNLP files. It was part of Oracle JDK until version 10. The last maintained JDK containing Java Web Start is Oracle JDK 8. See Oracle's [Java Client Roadmap Update](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javaclientroadmapupdatev2020may-6548840.pdf) for details.

Users that rely on JNLP but require a newer JDK have some options. There is an open-source reimplementation of Web Start called [IcedTea-Web](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/IcedTea-Web). It claims to be largely compatible with Web Start and should work with newer JDKs.

-   [OpenWebStart](https://openwebstart.com/) bundles IcedTea-Web with updaters and a control panel. Paid support is available, too.
-   [BellSoft](https://bell-sw.com/) provides [OpenWebStart](https://openwebstart.com/) as part of [BellSoft's support offering](https://bell-sw.com/support/).
-   [Azul](https://azul.com/) provides builds of [IcedTea-Web](https://www.azul.com/products/components/icedtea-web/).
