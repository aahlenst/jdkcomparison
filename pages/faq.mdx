## Which JDK Do You Recommend?

None.

This comparison aims to give you an overview of what JDKs are available and help you narrow down your choices.

If you are looking for an opinionated guide, other sites offer that, for example, [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com/).

## What JDKs Do You Plan on Adding? Why Are Some Missing?

The plan is to include all JDKs that are intended for production use and target a broader audience. Therefore, builds
that are supposed to facilitate the development of a JDK or are primarily used internally by a vendor will not make it
on the list.

JDKs that we plan to add, sorted alphabetically:

-   [Alibaba Dragonwell](https://dragonwell-jdk.io/)
-   [Azul Platform Prime](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)
-   [BellSoft Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/libericajdk/)
-   [IBM Semeru Runtime](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/)
-   [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
-   [OpenLogic OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
-   [Red Hat Build of OpenJDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)
-   [SAP SapMachine](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/)

JDKs that we do not plan on adding, sorted alphabetically:

-   [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Renamed to Eclipse Temurin.
-   All JDKs included in Linux distributions: Those that are not already on the list like Amazon Corretto (in Amazon
    Linux) are no stand-alone products. Furthermore, they would bloat the comparison even more.
-   [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime): Serves as platform for JetBrains' IntelliJ-based
    IDE, only.
-   [OJDKBuild](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild): Discontinued.
-   [Trava OpenJDK](https://github.com/TravaOpenJDK): Seems to primarily target developers, and to be dormant.

JDKs we are not sure about, sorted alphabetically:

-   [Axiom JDK](https://axiomjdk.ru/): Looks like a rebrand of BellSoft Liberica JDK for the russian market.
-   [Huawei BiSheng](https://www.openeuler.org/en/other/projects/bishengjdk/): Unclear whether it is targeting an
    audience outside of Huawei.
-   [Tencent Kona](https://github.com/Tencent/): Unclear whether it is targeting an audience outside of Tencent.

## Where Can I Learn More about Differences Between Versions?

The comparison does not include language-level differences between versions because there are no language-level
differences between vendors.

For a great overview of language-level differences between versions, see
[The Java Version Almanac](https://javaalmanac.io/). Furthermore, the
[list of JDK Enhancement Proposals](https://openjdk.org/jeps/0) (JEP) details both language-level differences and
technological changes like ports or garbage collectors.
