This comparison aims to give you an overview of what JDKs are available and help you narrow down your choices.

If you are looking for an opinionated guide, other sites offer that, for example, [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com/).

## What JDKs Do You Plan on Adding? Why Are Some Missing?

The plan is to include all JDKs that are intended for production use and target a broader audience. Therefore, builds
that are supposed to facilitate the development of a JDK or are primarily used internally by a vendor will not make it
on the list.

JDKs that we plan to add, sorted alphabetically:

-   [Alibaba Dragonwell](https://dragonwell-jdk.io/)
-   [Azul Platform Prime](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)
-   [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)
-   [BellSoft Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/libericajdk/)
-   [IBM Semeru Runtime](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/)
-   [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
-   [OpenLogic OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
-   [Red Hat Build of OpenJDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)
-   [SAP SapMachine](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/)

JDKs that we do not plan on adding, sorted alphabetically:

-   [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Renamed to Eclipse Temurin.
-   [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime): Serves as platform for JetBrains' IntelliJ-based IDE, only.
-   [OJDKBuild](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild): Discontinued.
-   [Trava OpenJDK](https://github.com/TravaOpenJDK): Seems to primarily target developers, and to be dormant.

JDKs we are not sure about:

-   [Huawei BiSheng](https://www.openeuler.org/en/other/projects/bishengjdk/): Unclear whether it is targeting an audience outside of Huawei.
-   [Tencent Kona](https://github.com/Tencent/): Unclear whether it is targeting an audience outside of Tencent.
